# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on 18th February 2022.

## TLDR

Lembot

- is GDPR compliant
- uses minimum personal data in order to run the service
- does not store any data about your leads

More details below üëá

## In general

Lembot.com will look after your data (email, name, account creation date) to resolve any questions addressed to the support.

## Your personal data

As a lembot user, the only personal data lembot.com stores about you is your _first name_, _last name_, _company name_, _email address_.

In order to run the service, when you save a bot, lembot.com stores _lemlist API keys_, _campaign IDs_, Google Sheets _spreadsheets IDs_ and _sheets IDs_. If you don't save the bot, none of these keys and ids are saved.

Only you can access your data.

This data is stored on databases within the EU and, as such, lembot.com is bound to EU data laws and practices such as GDPR.

### Deletion of your personal data

At any time you can request the cancellation of your account and full deletion of your data. This will remove all your personal data listed above.

To do so, please send your request to [privacy@lembot.com](mailto:privacy@lembot.com).

## Your lemlist leads and Google Sheets data

Lembot.com does **not** store at all the data of your lemlist campaigns, nor leads, nor the data in your Google Sheets.

Lembot automates the transfer from lemlist to Google Sheets: once the transfer is done (success or failure), lembot deletes the data right away.

What is `lembot@lembot.iam.gserviceaccount.com`?

Lembot needs write authorization to transfer your data in your Gsheet. To make your life easier, Lembot created what's called a [Google Service Account ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) you can share your GSheet with.

> A service account is a special kind of account used by an application (Editor's note: here lembot) rather than a person.

## Service providers

Lembot.com will send the minimum personal data to the following services listed below in order to complete the lembot.com service. These service providers are not permitted by law to disclose or use your personal data.

[Stripe ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://stripe.com/): payments processor (your email address as soon as you are a paying customer)

[Splitbee ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://splitbee.io/), a company based in Austria, Europe: usage analytics (your email address)

**Lembot's servers region**: Frankfurt Germany (West), Europe.

**Lembot's database region**: AWS Frankfurt (eu-central-1)

Should the list of data processors change, it will be noted on this page.
