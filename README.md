# Experimenting Github as a CMS üßë‚Äçüî¨

This repo is the CMS for lembot static pages:

- [/terms](https://lembot.com/terms)
- [/privacy](https://lembot.com/privacy)
- [/whats-new](https://lembot.com/whats-new)
- [/blog](https://lembot.com/blog) & blog posts

## Motivation

Like me, you probably focus all your effort in building a 100% custom `index.ts` home page to make it as **salesy** as possible.

What for all other pages, thoses pages where only the content matters?

For those pages, I wanted an easy way to generate them, edit them, write new ones, etc.

Using **markdown** and **github** sounds the best option for me because:

* I ‚ù§Ô∏è markdown: super simple to write and the result (headers, paragraphs, links) is 100% predictible
* I ‚ù§Ô∏è git: versioning comes for free
* I ‚ù§Ô∏è writing markdown on Github: the editor is smart enough üß†, has a preview mode üëÅÔ∏è and provides drag-n-drop free images hosting üåÜ

## How

I am using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/).

Building a website with nextjs is super easy and there are a lot of nextjs blog sample code out there (official [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript) for example).

Ok, it is super easy. But it's a bit of boilerplate code.

I wrapped this boilerplate code in simple functions like `getStaticPropsFromMarkdownFileUrl`, components like `<MarkdownPage />` and so.

Gonna share this soon.

Gonna be as simple as copy/pasting the `[nextmd].ts` file in your project.

```
pages/
  - [...nextmd].ts
```
