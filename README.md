## Motivation

Like me, you probably focus all your effort in building a 100% custom `index.ts` home page to make it as **salesy** as possible.

What for all other pages? You know, those pages where only the content really matters?

For those pages, I wanted an easy way to generate them, edit them, write new ones, etc.

Using **markdown** and **github** sounds the best option for me because:

* I ❤️ markdown: super simple to write and the result (headers, paragraphs, links) is 100% predictible
* I ❤️ git: versioning comes for free
* I ❤️ writing markdown on Github: the editor is smart 🧠, has a preview mode 👁️, provides drag-n-drop free images hosting 🌆, etc.

## How

I decided to release a library that enables us to generate static pages from markdown files with 0 effort, 0 boilerplate, and **most importantly**: dynamic routes, like nextjs does with `pages/`

It's now ready, it's called `next-markdown`

Give it a try, drop a star ⭐

I am waiting for your feedback 🙏

I am building this in public. [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/frouo) if you are interested.
