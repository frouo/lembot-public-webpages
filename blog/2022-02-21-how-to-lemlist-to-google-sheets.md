# How to Lemlist to Google Sheets

If you want to analyze the **results of your campaigns** more deeply, you would probably want to import them into Google Sheets.

Here is how to do it.

## The easy way

Use lembot üí™

Lembot automates the export of your lemlist campaign results (or activities) to your GSheet.

Follow the step-by-step guide to create your automation:

- **step 1**: paste your lemlist API key. At this point lembot automatically presents your campaigns so you can select the one you want to import in Google Sheets.
- **step 2**: paste your gsheet URL. At this point lembot automatically presents your spreadsheet's sheets so you can select where you want to import your campaign data.
- optionally, **shape** the output data
- optionally, **schedule** automatic export
- click **Save** and / or **Run Export**

That's it ü§©

## The hard way

Do it all by hand.

Without lembot things get harder. Here are the steps you need to follow to achieve the same result, all by hand:

- open your lemlist dashboard
- find and click on your campaign
- click Export
- wait until the export is ready üò¥
- download the CSV
- open your Google spreadsheet
- click File
- hover Import, click
- click the Upload tab
- click Select a file from your device
- find the right CSV among others on your computer, good luck when file name looks like `fil_axp_CvGPWvb3AxzDbFhJQ_campaign_x.csv` ü§Ø
- choose the right options for your import
- and finally, click Import data

Let's be honest, it's time-consuming and error-prone work with 0 added value.

Lembot automates all this so you can focus on what brings value to your business.
