# Hello world

## What is lembot

Lembot is an online automation tool dedicated to [lemlist](https://lemlist.com).

It automatically exports your Lemlist campaign results and activities in your Google Sheets.

Lembot aims to be your automation partner throughout your journey with Lemlist 🚀

Last but not least, lembot is not affialiated with lemlist. Although we had the chance to speak with G. who knew about lembot and kindly love and respect the idea.

## Why

Lemlist is awesome but it must remain simple and user-friendly. That's why lemlist can't do everything. Some features may be missing.

This is where lembot comes in.
