# Bulk lemlist campaign exports

Picture this, you have 26 campaigns, with different variables:

- **Campaign A**
- **Campaign B**
- ‚¨áÔ∏è
- **Campaign Z**

... that you want to export all at once in one single sheet, with columns matching of course!

This would be a nightmare by hand right? ü§Ø

Using lembot, it's super easy ‚úåÔ∏è

There is a feature designed just for that, it's called **megabot**.

## Demo
