# Remove the CSV header

The CSV header is the row that contains your columns name

![csv header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151677713-533bb9ae-66cf-4e2c-9a2f-1a721b8e7b93.png)

In some case you want to export your data without the header.

There is an option for that in lembot.

## How To

Choose keep header or remove header while creating a bot.

## Demo

In this demo, I use this feature to append an export to another. 

‚òùÔ∏è if you actually want to export several campaigns at once, in the same sheet, there is a feature just for that, it's called **megabot**. See [how to ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://lembot.com/blog/bulk-lemlist-campaign-exports).
