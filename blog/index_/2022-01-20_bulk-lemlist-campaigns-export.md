# How to export lemlist campaigns in bulk with megabot

Picture this, you have 26 campaigns, with different variables:

- **Campaign A**
- **Campaign B**
- ...
- **Campaign Z**

And you want all of them in one single sheet.

With columns matching!

This would be a nightmare by hand ü§Ø

Using lembot, it's super easy ‚úåÔ∏è

Just create a megabot then click "Run mega export".

# Creating a megabot is super easy

Go to [create new megabot page ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://lembot.com/dashboard/megabots/new)

Follow the 5 steps configuration tutorial

Click save

And that's it !

Schedule or run as many mega export as you need.
