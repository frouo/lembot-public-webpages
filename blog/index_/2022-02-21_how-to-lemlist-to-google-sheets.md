# How to lemlist to Google Sheets

If you want to analyze the results of your campaign more deeply, you can export them from lemlist and import them back to Google Sheets.

At this point you have the power of Google Sheets to make your data meaningful, draw stats, etc.

## Before lembot

All the details

- Export: Lemlist describes how to do so [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/4452750-export-my-campaign-results).
- Import: Google Sheets describes how to do so [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/40608).

To sum up, this are all the steps you must do. All by hand,

- open your [lemlist dashboard](https://app.lemlist.com)
- open Reports
- find and select your campaign
- click Export
- wait until the export is ready üò¥
- download the CSV
- open your Google spreadsheet
- click File / Import
- find the right CSV among others on your computer ü§Ø. Good luck when it looks like `fil_axp_CvGPWvb3AxzDbFhJQ_nouvelle_campagne_anne.csv` üòÖ
- choose the right options for your import
- and finally, click Import data

Let's be honest, it is a heavy duty. No one wants to do this every... week?

## Here comes lembot

Everything listed above is done automatically by lembot.

All you need to do is to create a `Bot`. A bot is like a zap for Zapier.

It is super easy:

- paste your lemlist API keys
- select the campaign to export
- paste your gsheet URL
- select your sheet
- (optionnaly) schedule automatic export
- save

Click Export whenever you need to export. That's it üéâ
