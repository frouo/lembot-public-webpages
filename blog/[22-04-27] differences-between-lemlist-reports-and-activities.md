# Lemlist Reports vs. Activities

## Reports

Lemlist campaign report gives you an overview of your campaign performance.

Report displays both positive and negative metrics for each buddy (lead email, custom vars, date and time email was sent, bounced, replied, opened etc.)

![lemlist report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/165455187-2e835d3e-8438-4a19-8304-3bba7cd0adcf.jpg)

### üí° what is the difference between the two red frames?

The first `sentAt` is the historical value for comptability and the other is the new column for each step.

## Activities

An activity is created for each action performed in the lemlist ecosystem.

When an email is sent, opened, bounced, a link is clicked, an new event is created with the **date and time** and the type of the event.

We listed every possible event types available in lemlist. The list is available [here](https://lembot.com/blog/how-to-export-lemlist-campaign-activities#event-types).

üí° Activity is the most valuable item for data analysis. Indeed, reports are build on top of activities.

### Use lembot to export activities

Lemlist dashboard does not offer such option.

Lembot is the only way to download all activities ‚úåÔ∏è
