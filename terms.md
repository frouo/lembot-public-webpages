## Us

Lembot charges for access on monthly plans. You can cancel subscription anytime from your dashboard, no questions asked.

Lembot's service may change without prior notice. Changes could affect pricing, pricing policies, features and access restrictions.

If you are a paying customer, your subscription (pricing) won‚Äôt change as long as you're a customer. For example, you subscribed to lembot at $10/mo, next year lembot is updating the pricing to $29/mo, your subscription will remain at $10/mo until you expressly cancel your subscription.

At signup lembot automatically subscribes your email to its newsletter. We are a small company focusing on delivering value: our newsletter is about what's new in lembot (new features). It happens every 2 weeks or so. You can unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.
